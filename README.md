## 🚀 Featured Work

### Human-in-the-Loop: AI Toolkit CLI with CI/CD automation
**📦 [Published npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@human-in-the-loop/cli) | [GitHub](https://github.com/codewizwit/human-in-the-loop)**

Open-source CLI toolkit solving the chaos of ungoverned AI tools across engineering teams. Provides standardized prompt management, contribution workflows, and accountability frameworks for responsible AI use.

**Built collaboratively with Claude** to dogfood the exact developer-first AI principles the toolkit promotes.

```bash
npm install -g @human-in-the-loop/cli
hit search "code review"
```

**Tech:** TypeScript, Nx monorepo, Commander.js, Inquirer.js, Jest  
**Impact:** Enables teams to discover, version, and govern AI tools from a single source of truth

## 📚 Learning in Public

### Curiosity-Documentation: Five Years of "How Does This Actually Work?"
**[GitHub repo](https://github.com/codewizwit/curiousity-documentation)** documenting my entire learning journey from bootcamp to production engineer.

What started as handwritten notebooks with question marks in margins became a comprehensive knowledge base covering Angular, React, AWS, testing strategies, responsible AI, and everything in between. 

**Highlights:**
- **The Archives**: 34 pages of digitized bootcamp notes showing the learning journey
- **Production topics**: Nx monorepos, Module Federation, GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda
- **Creative explanations**: Like explaining `null` vs `undefined` through a toilet paper meme
- **Real-world application**: Concepts that directly informed building Human-in-the-Loop

**Why it matters:** Shows continuous learning mindset, ability to teach complex concepts, and commitment to documentation as a core engineering practice.

## ✈️ Global Background

Lived in **six countries**: Taiwan, Latvia, Czech Republic, England, Scotland, and Poland.  
Originally from **Chicago**, currently in **Philadelphia**.

That global perspective shapes how I think about building inclusive, human-centered technology.

## 🌭 Why a Hot Dog?

Some of my earliest memories are sharing Chicago dogs with my dad at Gene & Jude's (no ketchup allowed). Years later, I carved a hot dog block print for my college capstone. The logo you see now is an AI-simplified version of that original print.

It's a symbol of nostalgia, connection, and continuity - a reminder that while AI can refine creativity, the spark, the story, the deeply human part, always comes first.
