## 📚 Learning in Public

### Curiosity-Documentation: Five Years of "How Does This Actually Work?"
**[GitHub repo](https://github.com/codewizwit/curiousity-documentation)** documenting my entire learning journey from bootcamp to production engineer.

Shows the evolution of my curiousity and learning. Handwritten bootcamp notebooks with question marks in margins grew into a comprehensive knowledge base covering Angular, React, AWS, testing strategies, responsible AI, and everything in between. 

**Why it matters:** Shows continuous learning mindset, ability to teach complex concepts, and commitment to documentation as a core engineering practice.

## ✈️ Global Background

Lived in **six countries**: Taiwan, Latvia, Czech Republic, England, Scotland, and Poland.  
Originally from **Chicago**, currently in **Philadelphia**.

That global perspective shapes how I think about building inclusive, human-centered technology.

## 🌭 Why a Hot Dog?

Some of my earliest memories are sharing Chicago dogs with my dad at Gene & Jude's (no ketchup allowed). Years later, I carved a hot dog block print for my college capstone. The logo you see now is an AI-simplified version of that original print.

It's a symbol of nostalgia, connection, and continuity - a reminder that while AI can refine creativity, the spark, the story, the deeply human part, always comes first.
