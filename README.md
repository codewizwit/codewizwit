## 🚀 Featured Work

### Human-in-the-Loop: AI Governance Toolkit
**📦 [Published npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@human-in-the-loop/cli) | [GitHub](https://github.com/codewizwit/human-in-the-loop)**

Open-source CLI toolkit solving the chaos of ungoverned AI tools across engineering teams. Provides standardized prompt management, contribution workflows, and accountability frameworks for responsible AI use.

**Built collaboratively with Claude** to dogfood the exact developer-first AI principles the toolkit promotes.

```bash
npm install -g @human-in-the-loop/cli
hit search "code review"
```

**Tech:** TypeScript, Nx monorepo, Commander.js, Inquirer.js, Jest  
**Impact:** Enables teams to discover, version, and govern AI tools from a single source of truth

## 📚 Learning in Public

### Curiosity-Documentation: Five Years of "How Does This Actually Work?"
**[GitHub repo](https://github.com/codewizwit/curiousity-documentation)** documenting my entire learning journey from bootcamp to production engineer.

What started as handwritten notebooks with question marks in margins became a comprehensive knowledge base covering Angular, React, AWS, testing strategies, responsible AI, and everything in between. 

**Highlights:**
- **The Archives**: 34 pages of digitized bootcamp notes showing the learning journey
- **Production topics**: Nx monorepos, Module Federation, GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda
- **Creative explanations**: Like explaining `null` vs `undefined` through a toilet paper meme
- **Real-world application**: Concepts that directly informed building Human-in-the-Loop

**Why it matters:** Shows continuous learning mindset, ability to teach complex concepts, and commitment to documentation as a core engineering practice.

## 🌭 Beyond the Code

- **Contributor** to Responsible AI Institute working group on governance and standards
- **Writer** at [Medium](https://codewizwit.medium.com) covering responsible AI, developer culture, and field notes through **Dispatch №13** series
- **Culture coordinator** at Vanguard's Philly office (led $150k fundraiser through company-wide hoodie design contest)

## 🎨 What Makes Me, Me

**Foodie** who believes the best conversations happen over good food • **Design nerd** (DePaul Media & Design grad) who brings visual thinking to technical problems • **Music lover** spanning hip-hop to doo-wop • **Sci-fi reader** pondering the future we're building • **Creative technologist** who sees code as craft

I bring structure to chaos, energy to meetings, and intention to process improvements. Known for making teams stronger through collaboration, not just code.

## ✈️ Global Background

Lived in **six countries**: Taiwan, Latvia, Czech Republic, England, Scotland, and Poland.  
Originally from **Chicago**, currently in **Philadelphia**.

That global perspective shapes how I think about building inclusive, human-centered technology.
