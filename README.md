# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexandra (codewizwit)

Software engineer building systems that put people first.  
I build developer tools that make Responsible AI usable and scalable, from publishing npm packages to enterprise-scale governance.

Here’s what that looks like in practice - a mix of independent exploration and applied engineering:

## 🚀 Featured Work

### Human-in-the-Loop: AI CLI Toolkit Featuring Resume Skills **(Passion Project)**
AI Toolkit and CLI NPM package. Provides standardized prompt management, contribution workflows, and automated accountability and quality assurance pipelines for responsible AI practices.  
My way to explore how Responsible AI principles can live inside developer tooling.  
[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@humans-in-the-loop/cli) | [`GitHub`](https://github.com/codewizwit/human-in-the-loop)


### Awesome AI *(Vanguard)*  
Building a governed registry of AI tools and prompts with CI checks for documentation quality, developer trust, and ethical impact.  
Demonstrates practical, team-scale adoption of Responsible AI standards in a real engineering environment.

## 📚 Learning in Public

### Curiosity-Documentation: Five Years of "How Does This Actually Work?"
**[GitHub repo](https://github.com/codewizwit/curiousity-documentation)** documenting my entire learning journey from bootcamp to production engineer.

Shows the evolution of my curiousity and learning. Handwritten bootcamp notebooks with question marks in margins grew into a comprehensive knowledge base covering Angular, React, AWS, testing strategies, responsible AI, and everything in between. 

**Why it matters:** Shows continuous learning mindset, ability to teach complex concepts, and commitment to documentation as a core engineering practice.

## 🎨 What Makes Me, Me

- **Ex-bartender** who invested life savings in coding bootcamp during covid lockdown and got an offer at Vanguard day of graduation <br>
- **Foodie** who believes the best conversations happen over good food (and best ideas spark from great snacks) <br>
- **Design nerd** (DePaul Media & Design grad) who brings visual thinking to technical problems <br>
- **Music lover** everything spanning hip-hop to doo-wop <br>
- **Sci-fi reader** pondering the future we're building <br>
- **Creative technologist** who sees code as craft <br>

I bring structure to chaos, energy to meetings, and intention to process improvements. Known for making teams stronger through collaboration, not just code.

## ✈️ Global Background

Lived in **six countries**: Taiwan, Latvia, Czech Republic, England, Scotland, and Poland.  
Originally from **Chicago**, currently in **Philadelphia**.

That global perspective shapes how I think about building inclusive, human-centered technology.

## 🌭 Why a Hot Dog?

Some of my earliest memories are sharing Chicago dogs with my dad at Gene & Jude's (no ketchup allowed). Years later, I carved a hot dog block print for my college capstone. The logo you see now is an AI-simplified version of that original print.

It's a symbol of nostalgia, connection, and continuity - a reminder that while AI can refine creativity, the spark, the story, the deeply human part, always comes first.
